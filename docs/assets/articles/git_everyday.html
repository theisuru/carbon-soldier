<h3>Git: made a mistake, reverting back to an older commit</h3>
<div>
  <h4>Temporarily switch to a different commit</h4>
  If you just want to temporarily go back to an earlier commit and comeback to HEAD, you can easily checkout the desired commit using commit hash
  If you want to temporarily go back to it, fool around, then come back to where you are, all you have to do is check out the desired commit:

  <pre><code>
    git checkout 0d1d7fc32
    # extract file from another commit
     git checkout [commit] -- [filename]
  </code></pre>

  This will detach you from the HEAD.
  If you want to start making changes from this commit, you can try to create a branch from there.

  <pre><code>
    git checkout -b old-state 0d1d7fc32
    # To go back to where you were (back to HEAD), simply checkout the branch
    git checkout dev
    # If you made changes while in old branch, you could reset to throw them away; you could stash, checkout, stash pop to take them with you; you could commit them to a branch there if you want a branch there
  </code></pre>

  <h4>Hard delete unpublished commits</h4>
  If you just want to delete everything you have since then

  <pre><code>
    # go back to previous commit but keep all the changes afterwords uncommitted
    git reset 0d1d7fc32
  </code></pre>

  <pre><code>
  # This will destroy any local modifications.
  # Don't do it if you have uncommitted work you want to keep.
  git reset --hard 0d1d7fc32
  </code></pre>

  <pre><code>
  # Alternatively, if there's work to keep:
  git stash
  git reset --hard 0d1d7fc32
  git stash pop
  </code></pre>

  <h4>Undo published commits with new commits</h4>
  On the other hand, if you've published the work, you probably don't want to reset the branch, since that's effectively rewriting history.
  In that case, you could indeed revert the commits. With Git, revert has a very specific meaning: create a commit with the reverse patch to cancel it out.
  This way you don't rewrite any history.

  <pre><code>
  # This will create three separate revert commits:
  git revert a867b4af 25eee4ca 0766c053
  </code></pre>

  <pre><code>
  # It also takes ranges. This will revert the last two commits:
  git revert HEAD~2..HEAD
  </code></pre>

  <pre><code>
  #Similarly, you can revert a range of commits using commit hashes (non inclusive of first hash):
  git revert 0d1d7fc..a867b4a
  </code></pre>

  <pre><code>
  # Reverting a merge commit
  git revert -m 1 [merge_commit_sha]
  </code></pre>

  <pre><code>
  # To get just one, you could use `rebase -i` to squash them afterwards
  # Or, you could do it manually (be sure to do this at top level of the repo)
  # get your index and work tree into the desired state, without changing HEAD:
  git checkout 0d1d7fc32

  # Then commit. Be sure and write a good message describing what you just did
  git commit
  </code></pre>
  The git-revert manpage actually covers a lot of this in its description. Another useful link is this git-scm.com section discussing git-revert.

  If you decide you didn't want to revert after all, you can revert the revert (as described here) or reset back to before the revert (see the previous section).
